# R-Development-Data-Dashboard
# This is a project I created in an intro to R class at Point Loma Nazarene University. 
# Inspired by the Savings Group Development Model, its goal is to explore the relationship between education 
# (of women in particular) and information communication technology with some basic development indicators. 
# All the data is downloaded from the UN or the CIA World Factbook, and the interactive data dashboard was 
# created with the Shiny package.

# A video presentation of how this project works and how it was built can be found here:
